# NetSec-Final-project
## SMS encryption
### This is the final project main folder
Unitl now the final idea is to use Needham-shroger with DH and authentication with 2FA and private keys.

  
  


## Major changes:
- Using CRC as the message size 160 byte is divisable by block size 64 bit.
- To minimize key size and maximize security we will use ECDH. so no need for smaller dh groups.
